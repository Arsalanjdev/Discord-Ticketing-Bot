## Contributing Code (Pull Requests)

We welcome code contributions! Please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top of the GitHub repository page.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch from the `main` branch (or the designated development branch) for your changes. Give your branch a descriptive name (e.g., `fix-bug`, `add-ticket-close-command`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```
3.  **Implement Your Changes:** Write the code to fix the bug or implement the feature.
4.  **Follow Coding Guidelines:**
    * Maintain a code style consistent with the rest of the project (generally adhering to PEP 8 for Python).
    * Write clear and well-commented code.
    * Include unit tests for new features or bug fixes (see the Testing section).
5.  **Update Documentation:** If your changes introduce new features or alter existing behavior, ensure you update the documentation accordingly.
6.  **Run Tests:** Ensure all tests pass. If you add new features, write new tests to verify them.
    ```bash
    # Example (into the next commit)
    pytest
    ```
7.  **Format Your Code:** Before submitting a pull request, format your code using a tool like `black` or `autopep8`.
    ```bash
    # into the next commit
    pip install black
    black .
    ```
8.  **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear and meaningful commit messages. Follow common commit message conventions (e.g., "feat: Add X feature", "fix: Resolve Y bug").
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "type: Short description of the change"
    ```
9.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
10. **Create a Pull Request:** From your forked repository page on GitHub, click the "Contribute" button and then "Open pull request".
11. **Describe Your Pull Request:** Provide a clear title and a detailed description of your changes, including the motivation and what your PR resolves or adds. Reference relevant issues using `#issue-number`.

## Testing

Including tests is crucial for ensuring the stability and reliability of the bot.

* **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests to verify the logic of individual functions and classes.
* **Integration Tests:** If your changes involve interaction between different parts of the bot or with the Discord API, consider writing integration tests as well.
* Follow the existing testing structure within the project. If no tests exist, we strongly encourage adding tests with your contributions.
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting your pull request.

## Documentation

Keeping the documentation up-to-date is essential.

* If you add new features, clearly describe them in the documentation.
* If you modify existing behavior, update the documentation accordingly.
* Pay attention to clarity and completeness in the documentation.
