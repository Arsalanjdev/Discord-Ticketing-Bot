# Security Policy

This document outlines the security practices we employ to protect your Discord ticketing bot and user data. We are committed to ensuring a safe and reliable environment for all users.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in the bot, please report it to us immediately. We appreciate your collaboration in helping us improve the security of our system.

**How to Report a Vulnerability:**

* please contact me into an github [issue](https://github.com/K0lin/Discord-Ticketing-Bot/issues).
* In your report, please include the following details:
    * A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
    * Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    * Potential impact of the vulnerability.
    * Any additional information you believe may be helpful.

We will treat your report with the utmost seriousness and strive to respond in a timely manner.

## Security Measures Implemented

We have implemented the following security measures to protect your bot and user data:

* **Credential Management:** Discord API keys and other sensitive secrets are securely managed and are not stored directly in the source code. We utilize environment variables or secret management systems to protect them.
* **Input Validation:** The bot performs validation of user inputs to prevent injection attacks and other exploits.
* **Data Sanitization:** User data is sanitized before being logged or displayed to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks (while less relevant in a Discord bot context, it's a good general practice).
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** The bot operates with the minimum permissions necessary to perform its functions. It is not granted any superfluous permissions.
* **Secure Logging:** Logs of messages and bot activities are stored securely, and access to these logs is restricted to authorized personnel. We take care not to log unnecessary sensitive information.
* **Regular Updates:** We keep the `discord.py` library and all other dependencies up-to-date to benefit from the latest security patches.
* **Code Review:** The bot's code is periodically reviewed to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.
* **Rate Limiting Protection:** We implement mechanisms to handle Discord's rate limiting effectively to prevent service disruptions and potential abuse.
* **Error Handling:** Errors are handled gracefully without revealing sensitive information to users.

## User Responsibilities

While we are committed to protecting your bot, you also play a role in security:

* **Do not share your bot's token with anyone.** The token is like a password for your bot.
* **Be cautious with the commands you execute within the bot.**
* **Keep your Discord account secure.** Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.
* **If you notice any suspicious behavior from the bot, report it to us immediately.**

## Security Incident Disclosure

In the event of a security breach that may compromise user data, we are committed to promptly informing affected users and providing transparent information about the incident and the measures taken to resolve it.

## Contact Us
